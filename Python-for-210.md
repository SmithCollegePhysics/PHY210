# Introduction

This is a collection of Python-based Jupyter Notebooks available for use in PHY 210.  The notebooks illustrate how to use the symbolic mathematics package SymPy to solve problems in 

1. basic mathematics 
2. ordinary differential equations (ODE)
3. Laplace Transforms
4. Fourier Transforms (coming soon)
5. linear algebra (and row reduction)

These notebooks were used as templates for advanced projects during Fall 2025.
